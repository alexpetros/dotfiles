To install, copy or symlink the User folder here to one of the following locations:

```
Windows: %APPDATA%\Sublime Text\Packages
MacOS: ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text/Packages
Linux: ~/.config/sublime-text/Packages
```

On MacOS, it looks something like this:
```
ln -s "$HOME/code/dotfiles/sublime/User/" "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text/Packages"
```

On open, Sublime will take care of the installation. Make sure that you've installed Package Control.
