# awp dotfiles
This is my dotfile repo!

Ultimately I would like this be more ambitious, but if you only start when you have a full plan then you'll never start at all! To that end, here are the beginnings of my configurations.

## setup
Run `make` in the repo root directory to create the symlinks which "install" the files. Don't try to run `make` from anywhere else, it won't work.

The installation script is "safe," so if you have an existing config, it will simply inform you that one already existis and leave it untouched.

## todo
* New configs
    * Add global gitignore
    * Prettify Vim config
    * Breakdown ZSH into components
* Scripts
    * Option on script to nuke existing configs, if they exist
    * Automatic Sublime installation
    * Make backups before installing
