The beginning of my dotifle repo

Ultimately I would like this be more ambitious, but if you only start when you have a full plan then you'll never start at all! To that end, here are the beginnings of my configurations.

## setup
Run `make` in the repository root directory to create the symlinks which "install" the files. Don't try to run `make` from anywhere else, it won't work.

## todo
* New configs
    * Add Sublime user folder
    * Add global gitignore
    * Prettify Vim config
    * Breakdown ZSH into components
* Scripts
    * Option on script to nuke existing configs, if they exist
    * Make backups before installing
