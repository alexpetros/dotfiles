# awp dotfiles
The beginning of my dotifle repo

Ultimately I would like this be more ambitious, but if you only start when you have a full plan then you'll never start at all! To that end, here are the beginnings of my configurations.

## todo
* Add Vim and tmux dotfiles 
* Add Sublime user folder
* Add git global settings
* Create streamlined installation / update process
* Revamp Vim formatting
* Breakdown ZSH into components

## inspiration
